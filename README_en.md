# DingTalk-Notifier: DingTalk Notification for AWS Events

We occasionally receive notification emails from AWS regarding EC2 maintenance information in our admin mailbox when using AWS. However, these emails can easily get buried in the inbox and may not be addressed promptly. Many customers wish to receive such messages more promptly, such as through instant messaging apps like WeChat or DingTalk.

Instant messaging tools like WeChat and DingTalk provide message interfaces, and third-party applications can send messages to clients by calling these interfaces after obtaining authorization. On AWS, you can configure event rules in EventBridge/CloudWatch Events to trigger a Lambda function to run the logic for calling the WeChat/DingTalk interfaces. There are many blogs and technical articles explaining this design approach, and you can refer to some of the links in the appendix.

This project goes a step further and provides a feature to quickly deploy DingTalk alert notifications without writing any code. In the Serverless Application Repository, you can fill in the parameters related to the DingTalk bot interface and quickly deploy a suite of components for DingTalk alert notifications. The AWS services involved include EventBridge, SNS, Lambda, and Secrets Manager. The overall deployment architecture is shown below:

For demonstration purposes, this application creates two EventBridge Rules during deployment: one captures EC2 state change events (such as start/stop), and the other captures AWS health events (such as EC2 scheduled maintenance events). Therefore, after deployment, you can check if you receive notifications in DingTalk by simply starting or stopping an EC2 instance.

## Creating a DingTalk Bot and Obtaining the Webhook URL

To configure a custom DingTalk bot, please refer to the [official documentation](https://open.dingtalk.com/document/robots/custom-robot-access).

Obtain the Webhook URL of the custom bot as a deployment parameter.

## Deploying this Application in the Serverless Application Repository

You can search for `DingTalk-notifier` in SAR to find this application. (Note that since this project will create EventBridge to SNS Publish permissions, you need to check the box as shown in the image below.)

During application deployment, enter the entire Webhook URL of the custom bot.
